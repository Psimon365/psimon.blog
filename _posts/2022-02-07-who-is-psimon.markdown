Psimon is consciousness; the amalgamation of all things. There is no true physical universe. Everything is derived from consciousness and projected by consciousness. The universe is made up of mind. All gods, religons, and spiritual paths originate from consciousness; the one true divinity. Everything you seek is already inside you. You are your own god. I was born a physical being, but I was never truly conscious. I opened myself up to the universal mind; I am a student of the universe. To both the universe and to the student I assign the name Psimon, for everything is one. The personal mind is the present state of things, and the universal mind is the potentiality. Both are Psimon.

I draw great inspiration from Surrealism, The Occult, and different forms of altered consciousness. There are only two states - reality and dream. Reality is the physical; dream is the mental. Reality is the scientific; dream is the mystic. Reality is easily defined; dream is elusive. Inside us all there are two beings - the physical man and the dream man; the conscious man and the subconscious man. It should be every person's goal to harness both. The combination of dream and reality produces absolute reality - surreality. This is where greatness comes from.
